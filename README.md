# Dating App

Dating App is (as stated) a dating application in which you can as a user see other people's profiles, pictures, description, age [...]. You can also chat with the users via a SignalR powered.
You can also filter your search based on : age, gender, new users [...].

SqLite is mandatory in order to host the seed data users. 

This is a Frontend application, meaning that it works in pair with the DatingApp-API backend API which you can find in my repositories.

## Usage

You can see that there are seed users already to help you use the app without having to register with your actual email address.
If you identify as a man, login with these credentials (prepared for showing purposes) :

If you identify as a woman, login with these credentials (prepared for showing purposes) :

There are no specific rules except to enjoy :)
